A temperature controller based on STM32F303 microcontroller, a DS18B20 temperature sensor, and a 20A relay provides precise temperature regulation. The STM32F303 processes temperature data from the DS18B20 sensor and compares it to a setpoint. If the temperature deviates, it activates or deactivates the 20A relay to control a heating or cooling device, maintaining the desired temperature. This setup is ideal for HVAC systems, industrial equipment, and home automation.
